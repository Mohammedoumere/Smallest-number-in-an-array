## Algorithm 
1. Initialize a variable `smallest` with the first element of the 
array. 
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element. 
3. Compare each element with `smallest`. 
4. If the current element is less than `smallest`, update 
`smallest` with the current element. 
5. After the loop ends, `smallest` will contain the smallest 
number in the array.
